   <h3><strong>howOld()</strong></h3>
   <p>
    Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. Handle three different cases:
   <ul>
     <li>If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:<br>
      <code>'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'</code>
    </li>
      
     <li>If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:<br>
      <code>'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'</code>
    </li>

    <li>If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:<br>
      <code>'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'</code>
    </li>
  </ul>

   <h3><strong>whatRelation()</strong></h3>
   <p>
    Given the percentage of DNA shared between two people, you can calculate their likely familial relationship. Hence, write a function, whatRelation(), that has one number parameter, percentSharedDNA, and returns the likely relationship. The number passed in should always be an integer from 0 to 100.

  <p>Here’s how it’s supposed to calculate the relationship:</p>
  <ul>
     100 should return 'You are likely identical twins.'<br>
     35-99 should return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'<br>
     14-34 should return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'<br>
     6-13 should return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'<br>
     3-5 should return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'<br>
     1-2 should return 'You are likely 3rd cousins.'<br>
     0 should return 'You are likely not related.'
  </ul>
   </p>

   <h3><strong>tipCalculator()</strong></h3>
   <p>
    Create a function, tipCalculator(), that has two parameters, a string representing the quality of the service received and a number representing the total cost.
   <p>
     Return the tip, as a number, based on the following:
     <ul>
       ‘bad’ should return a 5% tip<br>
       ‘ok’ should return a 15% tip<br>
       ‘good’ should return a 20% tip<br>
       ‘excellent’ should return a 30% tip<br>
       all other inputs should default to 18%
     </ul>
  </p>
   </p>
  </li>

   <h3><strong>toEmoticon()</strong></h3>
   <p>
     Write a function, toEmoticon(), that takes in a string and returns the corresponding emoticon as a string. Use a switch/case, and cover these cases:
     <ul>
      'shrug' should return '|_{"}_|'<br>
      'smiley face' should return ':)'<br>
      'frowny face' should return':('<br>
      'winky face' should return ';)'<br>
      'heart' should return '<3'<br>
      any other input should return '|_(* ~ *)_|'
    </ul>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
